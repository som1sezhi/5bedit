# 5bedit

level editor for BFDIA 5b ([play online here](http://bfdi.tv/5b/))
very wip, a lot of stuff is missing
also this is my first time using git/github so it may be really messy in here, sorry

## how to run

unzip 5bedit.zip and run the exe inside

alternatively, download the entire repository and run 5bedit.py with python (requires pygame)

## usage

left-click and drag to place tiles
right-click and drag to delete tiles
hold Z to place/delete tiles with a bigger brush
use the tray to the left to select the current tile (tile you want to place)
middle-click to set the tile you're hovering over as the current tile
hold space and drag to pan
